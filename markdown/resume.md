    Dedicated 12-week program specializing in highly focused, immersive training centered on Python/Django language fluency,
    object-oriented programming, and project-based learning.

    * Programmed full-stack web applications with Python and Django

    * Worked with Git and GitHub in a collaborative environment

    * Developed class projects with object-oriented programming to organize and modularize features

    * Mentored fellow students and reviewed their code in a way that led them to greater understanding of programming concepts

    * Pair-programed in an agile environment, both in person and remotely 

    * Created a crossword authoring web app using Vue.js as a final project (repo: <https://github.com/Crossword-Editor/crossword-editor>), 
    while working on a remote team

:   **Advanced Math Tutor for [Sylvan Learning](https://www.sylvanlearning.com/)** (Cary, NC).

    * Tutored high school math topics up through AP calculus AB/BC and SAT/ACT math preparation

    * Worked with up to three students at a time, but interacting with each student independently

    * Familiarized myself with elementary and middle school math curricula so I could also work with
    younger school students

    * Kept detailed records of each session with a student to track progress and provide feedback for parents


Aug 2011 - May 2018
:   **Instructor** University of Georgia (Athens, GA)

    * Part-time instructor until while I was a grad student as part of my support, with the same responsibilities of
    a full-time instructor, but a smaller teaching load

    * Responsible for managing time effectively, delivering lectures, preparing and grading tests/assignments,
    and responding to student feedback

    * Prepared me for working well with others and quickly learning technical concepts with a eye towards helping others


Aug 2015 - May 2016
:   **Writing Intensive Program Teaching Assistant** University of Georgia

    The Writing Intensive Program was an inter-department opportunity for graduate students to learn how to emphasize
    aspects of writing that are unique to their discipline

    * Created and graded assignments with professors meant to challenge students to write logical responses, as opposed
    to only computing a solution
