Corporate Experience
--------------------

August 2018 - January 2020
:   *Math Tutor for [Sylvan Learning](https://www.sylvanlearning.com/)*
    (Cary, NC).

    I tutor up to three students at a time, but interacting with each
    individually, in the more advanced math topics that Sylvan provides
    support for, which is predominately high school math topics up through
    AP calculus AB/BC and SAT/ACT math preparation.
    Occasionally I will work with elementary school students
    (or high schoolers in need of remedial help) on arithmetic fundamentals.
    I keep detailed records of each session with a student to track progress
    and provide feedback for parents.
