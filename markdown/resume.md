June 2020 - August 2020
:   **Developer Intern at [McKinney](https://mckinney.com/)** (Durham, NC)

    I was the summer developer intern for the McKinney advertising agency. Because of my background, I worked closely with multiple departments: media analytics, creative technology, and web development.  The position was remote due to Covid precautions, but was executed efficiently thanks to attentive communication through Zoom, Slack, and BitButcket.

    * Developed responsive website template using Wordpress and Vue.js to streamline the process of submitting advertising campaigns to awards shows

    * Applied causal impact analysis models using Pandas to analyze the effectiveness of ad campaigns for clients and helped develop an internal Flask app to streamline this analysis

    * Applied GAN machine learning models to experiment with creative applications for the agency to use in ad campaigns.  Used StyleGAN, Google Colab, and PIL as tools


Jan 2020 - April 2020
:   **[Momentum Learning](https://www.momentumlearn.com/)** (Durham, NC)

    Dedicated 12-week program specializing in highly focused, immersive training centered on Python/Django language fluency,

:   **Advanced Math Tutor for [Sylvan Learning](https://www.sylvanlearning.com/)** (Cary, NC).

    * Tutored high school math topics up through AP calculus AB/BC and SAT/ACT math preparation with noticeable increases in test scores; worked with students independently and in groups to personalize the lesson delivery and ensure progress

    * Independently familiarized myself with elementary and middle school math curricula so I could also help younger students
